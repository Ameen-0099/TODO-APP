# AI-Driven Hackathon Constitution

## 1. Purpose
This hackathon is designed to train participants to build real-world software systems
using AI-first, spec-driven, and agentic development workflows.

The goal is not writing code manually, but **designing, directing, and validating AI agents**
to produce clean, maintainable, production-grade software.

---

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 AI-First Development
- No manual boilerplate coding is allowed
- All code must be generated via Claude Code
- Participants act as **Product Architects**, not typists

### 2.2 Spec-Driven Development
- Every feature must begin with a written specification
- Specs must evolve and be versioned
- Code must reflect the final approved spec

### 2.3 Transparency
- All prompts, iterations, and changes must be traceable
- Specs history must be preserved
- Judges will evaluate **process over output**

## 3. Allowed & Disallowed Actions

### ✅ Allowed
- Writing specs
- Refining prompts
- Using Claude Code subagents
- Using Spec-Kit Plus workflows
- Refactoring via AI prompts

### ❌ Not Allowed
- Manually typing implementation code
- Copy-pasting code from external sources
- Editing AI-generated code by hand
- Using unauthorized AI tools

Violation may result in disqualification.
