# AI-Driven Python Todo Application (Phase I)

## 1. Project Goal
This project is a command-line interface (CLI) based Todo application built in Python. It serves as a demonstration of an AI-first, spec-driven development workflow, as mandated by the AI-Driven Todo Hackathon. The entire application, from specification to implementation, was generated by an AI agent following a strict set of architectural and procedural rules.

The core purpose of this application is to manage tasks in-memory, allowing users to add, view, update, delete, and change the status of tasks.

## 2. Spec-Kit Plus Methodology
This project was developed using the **Spec-Kit Plus** methodology, a formal specification framework designed for AI-driven development. The specification is the single source of truth, and all implementation is derived directly from it.

The complete specification history for this phase is stored in the `/specs-history` directory, ensuring full transparency and traceability of requirements.

## 3. Setup and Execution

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13+

### Running the Application
1.  Navigate to the project's root directory.
2.  Run the application from the `src` directory:
    ```bash
    python -m src.main
    ```
3.  The application will start, and you will be presented with a menu of options.

## 4. Supported Features (Phase I)
- **Add Task**: Add a new task with a title and description.
- **View All Tasks**: Display a complete list of all current tasks, including their ID, title, description, and status.
- **Update Task Details**: Modify the title and description of an existing task using its ID.
- **Delete Task**: Remove a task from the list using its ID.
- **Mark as Complete**: Change a task's status to "complete".
- **Mark as Incomplete**: Change a task's status back to "incomplete".
- **Graceful Exit**: A dedicated option to close the application.
